There are 4 elements:


1) The top hidden flap: next letter to be displayed

	2) Bottom hidden flap: next letter being displayed (bottom half) hidden, until flipped
	This is placed absolute, on the BACK of the (3) Top Shown flap and is rotated 180 deg
	so it flips down correctly to display the bottom half of the next character, upright.

3) The Top shown flap: current letter being displayed (top half)

4) The Bottom shown flap: current letter being displayed (bottom half)

#2 is the problem. 
	If I animate the flap to flip down correctly, the backside is NEVER able to rotate the letter and display correctly. 


I have several CodePens to this effect: Flip Card 1-5. Each having a different experiment. 

I'm moving on to a simpler idea. 

The screen will fill with X rows (vw/min 10, max 50) and x cols (vw/min 10, max 50)

Responsive to screen size, and Larger/Smaller sliding input.
